          ### Installing the Collection from Automation Hub

          Before using the collection, you need to setup Ansible Automation Hub as galaxy server; then install it via the CLI:

              ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.eap
      - placeholder: support
        content: |
          ## Support

          The redhat.eap collection v{{ galaxy_version | default('0.0.0-dev') }} is released as the [Red Hat Ansible certified content
          collection for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/eap) with
          [Production Support](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/production).
          If you have any issues or questions related to this collection, please contact support at [Red Hat Customer
          Experience & Engagement](https://access.redhat.com/support/). Alternatively contact the community by opening
          an issue at https://github.com/ansible-middleware/wildfly/issues.

          For more information about using this collection, see [Installing JBoss EAP by using the Red Hat Ansible Certified Content
          Collection](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.4/html/installing_jboss_eap_by_using_the_red_hat_ansible_certified_content_collection/index).

          ## Downloading products from the Customer Portal

          The `redhat.eap.eap_install` role supports downloading and installing from the Red Hat Customer Portal using credentials associated to a service account. After
          login in the customer portal and navigating to the hybrid cloud console, select the [services account tab](https://console.redhat.com/application-services/service-accounts)
          to create one, if needed. Client ID and Client secret associated to the service account needs to be provided with the following variables are defined:
          ```
          rhn_username{{':'}} '<client_id>'
          rhn_password{{':'}} '<client_secret>'
          ```

          The downloaded product archive will be stored in the controller working directory, and then distributed to target nodes.

          When patching is requested, via the `eap_apply_cp` variable, the most recently published cumulative patch will be installed; to use a specific patch version instead,
          set it with the `eap_patch_version` variable.

          NOTE: downgrading patches is not supported.

          #### Downloading from the Customer Portal

          The `rhbk` role supports downloading and installing from the Red Hat Customer Portal using credentials associated to a service account. After having
          authenticated in the customer portal, navigate to the hybrid cloud console, and select the [services account tab](https://console.redhat.com/application-services/service-accounts)
          to create one, if needed. Client ID and Client Secret associated to the service account need to be provided to the collection using the following variables:
          ```
          rhn_username{{':'}} '<client_id>'
          rhn_password{{':'}} '<client_secret>'
          ```

          The downloaded product archive will be stored in the controller working directory, and then distributed to target nodes.
